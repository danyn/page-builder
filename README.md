# Page Builder for Debut theme on Shopify

All this does is take the sections from the sections folder in Debut and turn them into one section with blocks. This section can be used to build pages with the same kind of pagebuilder that Debut has for the homepage.  To do so currently you would have to manually create a new template and then tell it to use this section.  What this does is create identical static sections, where information for this individual pages is written into the one and only Config/settings_data.json - which is where all the customizations for the homepage are written by default.
